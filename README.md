# Ansible
I great tool to help me set everything as i want.
I'm most likely going to save here playbooks for :
 - Setting up my self-hosted runners ✅
 - Install Docker or Podman where i need to ✅
 - Setting up a monitoring solution : Prometheus / Grafana
 - *Bonus: i might add a playbook for setting up my personnal developpment environment with neovim / tmux / docker~podman*
